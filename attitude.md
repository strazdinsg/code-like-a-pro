# Professional Attitude

The tips in this section are all about showing professional attitude towards yourself and others.
Although this is not directly code-related, it has a tremendous impact on how well you and your team
perform. The quality of code definitely depends on the things mentioned here.

## The team owns the code, not you

Developers sometimes get emotionally attached to the code they write. OK, let's be honest: not just
sometimes, but always. When you build things (write code) you feel like this is the sand castle you
are building. And then someone comes and ruins it...

As a consequence, other developers feel afraid to touch your code even when they see need for
improvement. The next thing you know - the code starts roting, the quality degrades over time.

Try to always remember that the team (or the project) owns the code! It does not matter who wrote
it. The goal of the whole team is to deliver the best code possible. Therefore, if you see some
places where code needs cleaning or bug-fixing - go ahead and fix it. If another team member sees an
opportunity for code extension or cleanup, (s)he will do the same.

When someone has improved your code, don't get angry, say "Thank you".

## Learn, don't just deliver

Projects often have deadlines. Deadlines mean some stress and pushing ourselves to the limits
(or procrastinating way too long and then pushing us). As a result, we focus on delivering. The
customer (or the teacher) is expecting a result. We just want to "get it working". But when will you
learn and improve, if all you do is deliver?

If you look at professionals, the quality of their work today and 10 years ago is totally different.
It feels like the pro today is a completely different person. How do you get from a novice to a pro?
You learn and improve, step by step. Exponential growth applies to knowledge as well. If you get 1%
better every week, it may feel like a tiny improvement. But if you keep that steady 1%/week
improvement pace, you will be 67% better in a year and around 17600% better in ten years! That's an
insane improvement, you'll be a completely different person!

Try to learn something in every project, in every sprint, every day. It does not necessarily mean
you need to apply a new Javascript framework in every project. You need to also be efficient at what
you do, you get efficient when you repeat some things several times. But remember that learning and
improving is part of your job.

This is probably not a problem at a university. If you are a student, most things are new to you,
and you learn anyway. But when you go out and work in the industry, you may feel like delivering all
the time, things start to look repetitive , and the work may get dull. Then you start doubting your
competence, your life choices. You feel stuck, your inner impostor awakens. You start thinking about
quitting.

Remember to _sharpen the saw_!

## Study theory, don't just try

Students often like to learn by example. Say you want to learn the ReactJS framework. It is tempting
to watch a guy on YouTube building a project with ReactJS and follow along. There is so much content
out there that you can literally find an example for every project you can imagine. So you watch
that guy, you copy his/her code. You get the thing done. Now what? Did you understand how things
work with ReactJS? What happens when you need to build another project with ReactJS?

If you don't learn what the framework offers, you never get past the stage of a YouTube junkie, who
clings to someone else's help every time you need to build something. It's like needing your big
brother to always protect you. Such approach increases your inner insecurity. Also, you never get
effective in applying the tool, because you don't know what it offers. You have seen only one small
side of it, as explained by a youtuber (who probably does not really understand the tool anyway).

The point is, you should learn the tools, technologies and techniques. By "learn" I mean "study some
theory". The term _theory_ has got a negative connotation in the society, and that is a shame. We
need action and practice, of course. But in many cases theory is what separates OK from good. It
makes the difference between "can DO it" and "UNDERSTAND HOW to do it and WHY". You can hit a screw
with a hammer (or with a stone), and it will work if you are strong and persistent enough. But
wouldn't it be nice to know _a bit of theory_ about screws and screwdrivers, including the electric
ones? Not only would the work be easy and give you more pleasure, but also the quality of the result
would increase tremendously. Another important effect: your sense of self-worth and confidence would
improve. When you lay in your bed after a long day of _screwing_ you would think "phew, I
accomplished a lot today".

Btw, you don't need to know about screw sizes, angles of the threads or metal types. You don't need
to know how screws are produced. You need to only know a bit about the difference between nails and
screws, their use indoors and outdoors, available tools, etc. Learning theory doesn't mean
remembering formulas or theorems. It means understanding the philosophy behind the tools and
techniques you use, having an internal reflection on why you should or shouldn't use it in your
projects. It means taking new jigsaw puzzle pieces and putting them in the right places in your
brain. When you do this, with every new project your competence gets wider and richer.

If you are a student, you can ask your teacher. Don't just accept the slides and lectures they throw
at you. If you have holes in your understanding, ask the teacher for help. The teacher will usually
like it, because it means someone is interested in the stuff they are talking about. You fill the
gaps in your understanding and the teacher feels happy. Win-win :)

Speaking about teachers... One good way to learn is preparation for teaching. If you had to give a
20-minute lecture on ReactJS (or any other topic), what would you talk about? Which are the most
important concepts in ReactJS? What problems does it solve? What new problems does it introduce?
Make a list of the important concepts. Then ask a question - do I understand how these concepts work
and why? Now go out and use any learning resources you can and study until you understand it, use
the goddamn YouTube if you will.

Wouldn't it be nice to be the wise guy whom people go to, because they know that you _know_?
Wouldn't it be great to work in a team where everyone shares the philosophy of understanding instead
of just doing? How would you feel about working in such a group of wise experts? Or would you rather
prefer to work in a team where the work stops when YouTube has a maintenance break?

## Take care of your physical body

I hate to break the news, but as much as you may love programming, you are still a sack of meat,
bones and some fluids. That sack of bio-material, also known as "the physical body" needs some care.

Our bodies are very intelligent systems. Resource prioritization is an automatic function of the
body. In short - you get more of what you need, and you lose what you don't use. We constantly send
messages to the "logistics centers" of our body. Don't believe in it? Try
training [the biceps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0deQPDVFZ8) of your left arm (and only it)
actively for 30 days and see how it grows in comparison to other muscles you don't train.

We have hundreds of muscles, bones and joints in our bodies. But we normally use a very limited set
of those. If all you do is sit in a chair in front of a screen for 8+ hours every day, what message
are you sending to the body? You are actively saying "Hey, listen, pal. As you may have noticed, I'm
very glad in sitting - both at the office and at home. Could you be so kind and store some more fat
on my bum, so that sitting is more comfortable? If you need some resources, take it from the muscle
on my legs and arms, I don't use them actively anyway."

This is not a fitness website and I won't talk long about the right techniques for exercise. The
important thing is - you need to keep your body alive and active if you want to be able to work
actively for many years. Just find the activities you like to do. Go hiking, jogging, do group
training, weight lifting or whatever. Keep the blood circulating, bring the oxygen to your brain.
Take care of your body so that you can sleep well at night and recover for tomorrow.

Another important principle of exercise: work in shifts, have breaks in between. Your muscle does
not grow during the exercise. You actually shred it into pieces during a good exercise. The muscle
grows while you sleep. In the same way, the neural networks in your brain actually grow stronger
while you take a break.

I don't like the term "work-life balance", because I see work as an important part of life. But the
idea is an important one nevertheless. Have some variety in your life: family, work, exercise,
hobbies, and rest. Mix all of those, as no single component will make you happy. Sometimes the best
way to increase performance at work is to add some time for exercise to your schedule.

Think about the messages you want to send to your body!
