# Testing

TODO:
* Test mostly business logic. Need to have proper structure for that to work.
* User-testing as early as possible, as often as possible
* Use realistic test data
* When you find a bug, try to create a test case for it first
* Re-entrant tests
* Don't use production database for tests
* Take care of code structure for tests as well
* "There will always be bugs" is no excuse for testing
* Use more time on testing, less on debugging
