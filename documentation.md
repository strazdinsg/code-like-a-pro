# Documentation

TODO:
* README
  * Remove the default auto-generated text
  * About the project
  * Getting started
* JavaDoc/JSDoc/PhpDoc/...
* Document all public classes and methods
* Should you document all getters and setters == should you HAVE all getters and setters? 
  Using a class for data storage only == Perhaps a record instead?
* For non-intuitive internal methods as well
* Make sure documentation is synced with the actual code (variable names, explanations, exceptions)
* Remove @author, @version comments, use GIT for it
* Who decides when the code is "self-documenting"? Don't use it as an excuse
* Always consider that you code is open-source and junior devs will join the team
