# Code Like a Pro

Tips for (beginner) programmers on how to improve the quality of your code and the development
process in general.

The tips here are based on my experience as a software developer and teacher.

This project is mostly devoted to students who want to excel in their career as software developers.
Throughout the years I have seen hundreds of student projects which involve different forms of
programming: from robots to websites and mobile apps. I see the same typical mistakes every year.
Here I summarize them, add suggestions on what to avoid, and add some tips based on my own (and my
colleague) experience.

[The lives of everyone on this planet depend on software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tng6Fox8EfI).
The quality of software depends largely on the quality of the source code we write. Neither the
client, nor the manager understand the term "source code quality". The responsibility lies
therefore on our shoulders, dear programmers! We are the ones who need to write clean code, 
document it, and communicate the work in a clear way, despite the deadlines and tight budget. 

Remember, my programmer friend - next time you get lazy or sloppy, lives are at stake! ;)
